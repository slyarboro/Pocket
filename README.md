# Pocket

Pocket is an application that improves productivity, provides structure, possibility and positivity to your day -- pronto!

Pocket your picks, people! Line your Pockets with URLs of picture albums you plan to peruse, or perhaps a performance you'd prefer to play once you find pause in your pace.

Revisit a particular passage, a Pinterest board perfectly curated for a peculiar interest, or perhaps a power-hungry professional's portfolio Pocketed as motivation to push past what you previously considered to be the peak of your potential. Your personalized Pocket saves provide direct paths to an unlimited number of webpages, making an otherwise hair-pulling/persnickety process quick, painless and profoundly effective.

Users are encouraged to keep parents, partners and compadres in the proverbial loop by promoting the app and inviting them to try Pocket on for size!

In addition to Pocketing your own saves, public profiles allow Pocket pickers to put their paws on repositories of the app's other users. So go ahead, bookmark that political opinion piece you've been meaning to pass along to your pops. Pack your Pocket with those PowerPoint presentation PDFs on pollution parallels of pesticides and poorly pollinated plants from your pal Patricia's profile, because hey, maybe y'all are into that sort of thing. Punny pet pictures, prospective passion projects, parody platforms, comprehensive lists of party anthems and popular Pitbull earworms you happened upon while searching for reasonably priced timber wood -- and even that Pandora playlist you made of exclusively Passion Pit deep cuts and Prince EPs that you'd prefer to keep off of your Google+ page -- What a time to be alive.

Maximize your personal Pocket's potential and stockpile prime picks other people's Pockets are sure to possess.

Why jeopardize your patience and pleasant disposition with a painstaking scroll through previously previewed pages, or commit the time it takes to pen webpages of interest to paper? Preserve mental clarity, stay relevant, make your parents proud, and (probably) even save a few trees.

Forever pick Pocketing unlimited Pocket picks makes it possible to find precise URLs you've browsed and housed from other browser trousers, both off the cuff and on the fly. 

Current users are sweeping up the proficiencies and prowess of a meta Mary Poppins performing in millennial mode, and the reviews are unanimous:
